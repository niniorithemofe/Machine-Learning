# Machine-Learning projects
object dection, object classification, Arima model, gaussian process regression, lasso regression, pretrained models and stuff like that 

# Waste classification project
this is a classification model that is used to classify waste into various categories such as cardboard, glass, plastic.includes data preprocessing, augmentation and hypertuned paramters

# Object dection project:
this project utilizes the yolo objection pretrained model for object dection. includes data preprocessing, augmentation and hypertuned paramters

# Donation item label and image classifier:
this project is a part of the sharebox app which is a optimized donation box system. that uses the label and images of a submitted donation to decided whether the donation should be accepted or recycled
