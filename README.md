# Machine Learning Projects
Includes a range of machine learning techniques such as object detection, object classification, ARIMA modeling, Gaussian Process Regression, Lasso Regression, and the use of pretrained models. These projects focus on both predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making, incorporating data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

# Waste Classification Project
A classification model designed to categorize waste into distinct types such as cardboard, glass, and plastic. The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing, data augmentation techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy and robustness.

# Object Detection Project
This project leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) pretrained model for real-time object detection. Key components include image preprocessing, data augmentation, and fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance detection accuracy and efficiency.

# Donation Item Label & Image Classifier (ShareBox App)
Part of the ShareBox application—an optimized smart donation box system—this project involves a classification model that evaluates both the image and label of submitted donations. The model determines whether an item should be accepted or redirected for recycling. The system includes data preprocessing, image augmentation, and model optimization to ensure reliable classification.
